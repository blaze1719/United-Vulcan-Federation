# United Vulcan Federation
United Vulcan Federation | A mod for Stellaris


After an age of violence and war, the once-divided Houses of Vulcan now have done what no other Conclave has ever accomplished in our over 10,000 year history: they have chosen a Leader. This process was far from peaceful and rarely, if ever, civil, however the divided people of Vulcan and their myriad leaders have found a path to peace: by uniting through their common bond of Logic. 

Administrator Sarek of Vulcan, your people look to you, the newly-appointed head of our Conclave of Houses and Collective Planetary Government, to lead us to beyond the stars! Under your short but prosperous rule, our military-industrial complex was converted from a war-driver into a global network of labs and testing centers, and within the first year of your 5-Year-Plans, the people of Vulcan had created a crude and primitive inter-planetary drive, and now, during the 5th and final year of the Plan, we have our first tested and working interstellar drive, now being named by our lead scientists as a 'Warp Drive.'

Administrator Sarek, your people look to you to give them strength in the gathering storm of our now reachable galaxy. Who knows what wonders we will find in the void? The stars, and our Destiny, awaits!

This small species mod is the first mod I've ever attempted and I wrote it to build some confidence and become more familiar with the modding process. Being a large Star Trek fan (who playing this game isn't?), I wanted to create something that was simple enough to learn quickly but not too hard as to deter me from continuing learning how to create a mod, and this was the product!

I present the United Vulcan Federation!

I am unsure if this mod is Ironman Compatible or not;
If it is not, and you know how to fix it, please let me know!
